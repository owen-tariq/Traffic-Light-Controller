# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Controller ðŸš¦

Welcome to the **Traffic Light Controller** project, my grand finale for the **ETEC 122** course! This project showcases a working simulation of a traffic light system, coded entirely in VHDL. It's been a fun and challenging journey, and Iâ€™m excited to share the results with you!

## Project Overview

Imagine a busy intersection, and itâ€™s your job to ensure that cars and pedestrians move safely and efficiently. This Traffic Light Controller does just that! Itâ€™s designed to switch between red, yellow, and green lights based on timed sequences, using VHDL to bring this everyday technology to life.

This project was the capstone of my **ETEC 122** course, where I dove deep into digital systems and FPGA design. From concept to simulation, this project encapsulates the skills Iâ€™ve developed throughout the course.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a peek under the hood:

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€ MyTrafficLight.vhd                 # The heart of the traffic light controller
â”œâ”€â”€ My7SegmentDisplay.vhd              # A 7-segment display for countdown timers
â”œâ”€â”€ Project_FreqDiv.vhd                # Frequency divider for clock signal management
â”œâ”€â”€ MyProject_TrafficLight.bdf         # Block diagram visualizing the project
â”œâ”€â”€ simulation/                        # All things simulation!
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modelsim/                      # ModelSim scripts and output files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ qsim/                          # Quartus simulation scripts
â””â”€â”€ docs/                              # Any additional documentation
```

### Key Files

- **`MyTrafficLight.vhd`**: This is where the magic happens. It controls the sequence of lights based on time intervals.
- **`My7SegmentDisplay.vhd`**: A nifty little add-on that shows how much time is left before the light changes.
- **`Project_FreqDiv.vhd`**: A frequency divider to adjust the clock signal, ensuring the lights change at the correct intervals.
- **`MyProject_TrafficLight.bdf`**: A block diagram file that ties everything together visually.

## Features

- **Realistic Traffic Light Sequences**: The traffic light cycles through red, yellow, and green with realistic timing.
- **7-Segment Display Integration**: A countdown timer that lets drivers know when the light will change.
- **Modular Design**: Each component (traffic light controller, display, frequency divider) is modular, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To jump into this project, youâ€™ll need:

- **Quartus Prime**: Intel's FPGA design suite, your main tool for this project.
- **ModelSim**: To simulate and verify the VHDL code.
- **Basic VHDL Knowledge**: If you can read and write VHDL, youâ€™re good to go!

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-light-controller.git
    ```
2. Fire up Quartus Prime:
    - Open the `Project_FreqDiv.qpf` file to start exploring the project.

## Simulation

### ModelSim Simulation

1. Navigate to the `simulation/modelsim` directory.
2. Load the provided `.vho` or `.do` files into ModelSim.
3. Run the simulation and watch as the traffic lights cycle through their sequence!

### Quartus Prime Simulation

1. Head over to the `simulation/qsim` directory.
2. Open and simulate the `.vwf` files in Quartus Prime to see the controller in action.

## Future Improvements

- **Pedestrian Crossing**: Add a pedestrian crossing button that integrates with the traffic light sequence.
- **Emergency Vehicle Detection**: Implement a system that gives priority to emergency vehicles, altering the light sequence accordingly.
- **Dynamic Timing**: Adjust the timing based on traffic density using sensors.
